# Playground
The playground has 4 major components: swingset, merry-go round, effects panel and touch pads. 
The code here converts the sensor data into midi triggers to use within ableton. The code is written in CPP because they are going onto arduinos. 

Since there are 4 major components you will see those in the major folders and then a series of additional folders that pertain to each component. 
For instance, the Merry-go round had a wifi module at one point so there were files associated with that.
